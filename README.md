### Project Title
Analyze BikeShare Data with Python

### Description
The goal of this project was to use Python to create a script that will allow a user to evaluate Bike Share data from one of three cities.

The program works by allowing a user to select a city, month, and day of the week to be analyzed for multiple outputs of information. While selecting a city is mandatory, the user could select all for months and/or days of the week.

### Files used
chicago.csv  
new_york_city.csv  
washington.csv  

`all three contain bike share date for the specified city and were provided through the Udacity Python for Data Science Nanodegree`
